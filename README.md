# badbank
Refactoring the "Bad Bank" exercise and adding additional functionality.

The web application I'm currently working on is a demonstration of a banking and ATM system. It utilizes technologies like Node, Express, and MongoDB. At the moment, I am in the process of refactoring some of the code that was previously covered in the course. Rest assured, I am committed to updating the project gradually over the next few weeks.

As for the current functionality, users can perform deposits, withdrawals, and check their account balance. Moving forward, I have plans to introduce additional features such as account creation, logging in and out, and the ability to manage multiple accounts with the option for transfers.
